# Why ?

In my opinion Calibre is a marvelous tool but is too big and has too much
dependencies to be used for its content server.

That's the main reason why I coded this OPDS server. I needed a simple
tool to be installed on a small server (Seagate Dockstar in my case).

I initially thought of Calibre2OPDS but as it generate static file no
search was possible.

Later I added an simple HTML catalog that should be usable on my Kobo.

So COPS's main advantages are :
 * No need for many dependencies.
 * No need for a lot of CPU or RAM.
 * Not much code.
 * Search is available.
 * With Dropbox / owncloud it's very easy to have an up to date OPDS server.
 * It was fun to code.

If you want to use the OPDS feed don't forget to specify feed.php at the end of your URL.

# Prerequisites

1. 	PHP 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6 or hhvm with GD image processing, Libxml, Intl, Json & SQLite3 support.
2. 	A web server with PHP support. I only tested with various version of Nginx.
    Other people reported it working with Apache and Cherokee. You can also use PHP
    embedded server (https://github.com/seblucas/cops/wiki/Howto---PhpEmbeddedServer)
3.  The path to a calibre library (metadata.db, format, & cover files).

On any Debian base Linux you can use :
 aptitude install php5-gd php5-sqlite php5-json php5-intl

On Centos you may have to add :
 yum install php-xml

# Install

1.  Extract the zip file to a folder in web space (visible to the web server).
2.  If you're doing a first-time install, copy config_local.php.example to config_local.php
3.  Edit config_local.php to match your config.
4.  If needed add other configuration item from config_default.php

If you choose to put your Calibre directory inside your web directory then you
will have to edit /etc/nginx/mime.types to add this line :
application/epub+zip epub;

If you like Docker, you can also try [this project](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-cops)

# Known problems

Not a lot, except for the bad quality of the code (first PHP project ever) ;)
