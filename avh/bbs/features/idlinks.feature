Feature: ID links are shown if templates are active

	Typical book IDs are ISBN numbers or IDs from distributors
	(like Amazon, Apple, Google ...) or URLs. Using ID templates 
	these IDs can be automatically transformed into HTTP links 
	to various other web sites, e.g. a ISBN search engine or book 
	catalogs.

	Scenario: If no ID templates are configured, there are no ID links

	Scenario: Book pages with suitable IDs contain ID links

	Scenario: Book pages without suitable IDs contain no ID links
